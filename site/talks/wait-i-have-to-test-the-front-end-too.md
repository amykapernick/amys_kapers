title: Wait, I have to test the front end too?
---
Testing is important right? Your project can't be run unless all your unit and integration tests are written (and pass), but are you also testing the front end?

There are so many different tests we need to be running on the front end - accessibility testing, performance testing, user testing, HTML validation, visual regression testing - it's hard to work out what you need to test for and how to set it up.

Join me to learn about the different types of front end tests and find out where you need to use them, while I show you how to set them up in a live example application.
